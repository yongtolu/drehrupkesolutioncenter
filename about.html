<h2>ABOUT DR.ERHUKPE</h2>
<p>Dr. Ehrukpe is a vibrant young man in his early 50s. He believe in the power of roots
 and herbs and have spent most of his life studying and learning how to cure many diseases with herbs 
 and roots. He spent time to examine and understand each and every leaf,roots,herbs and some natural 
 resources,mastering their use,work and how it applies to humans. Dr. Ehrukpe don't just believe in 
 herbal medicine, he practices it knowing and strongly believe that we came from nature and nature is
 what fuels us and called it a HERBAL LIFE, it is an African path and I advise the world should take that path.

<h2>ABOUT THE HERBAL REMEDY</h2>

<p> Thereafter Herbal medicine is also called phytomedicine or phytotherapy. Par-herbalism describes alternative and pseudoscientific practices of
using unrefined plant or animal extracts as unproven medicines or heath-promoting agents. Paraherbalism differs
 from plant-derived medicines in standardize biologically active compounds,but rather relies on the belief that preserving various substances
 from a given source with less peocessing is sager or more effective-for which there is no evidence.</p>
